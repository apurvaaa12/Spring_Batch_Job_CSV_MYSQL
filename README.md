# DataSwift
If you plan on migrating your data from one database to another or if there's a requirement for you to make multiple updates or inserts to your database this application is your one-stop. It did not take more than 5 minutes to transfer 7 billion records from the Oracle database to MySQL. This application is an example of reading data from CSV files and writing it down in the MYSQL database.
